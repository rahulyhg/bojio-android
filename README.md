## Bojio! - The Android Scheduling App

This is an Android application which compares multiple .ics files and return the timeslots when there are no events in any of the calendars simultaneously. THis is to allow people to share their calendars and be able to find a common timeslot to meet-up.

## Using

- Clone the repository
- Use Android Studio's Emulator to run the app. (We used a Nexus 6P Marshmellow for all tests)


## Branch Policy

We follow the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) when developing the application, and name our branches as follow:

- `master` is the active development branch

Local development branch naming:

- `feature/<your-branch-name>` for substantial new feature or function
- `enhance/<your-branch-name>` for minor feature or function enhancement
- `bugfix/<your-branch-name>` for bug fixes

Please make sure that you have tested the changes on the android emulator before pulling a request.
